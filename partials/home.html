    <h2>INTRODUCTION</h2>
    <img src="../img/article1.jpg"> A new cultural centre and social learning hub to stimulate the mind through multisensory learning. Bringing people together, igniting and exciting the imagination through contemporary science and art workshops, events and activities. Fostering a creative edge in anyone and marrying inspired thinking with innovation, technology, learning and socializing.
    <br> Our venue will house a beautiful, contemporary café-bar, studios and store but our primary source of revenue will be through unique workshops held in atmospheric 'studiolabs'. These studiolabs, with interchangeable lighting, sound, scent and expert tutors, will create drama and a truly memorable learning experience. <br> Customers will linger and mingle in our unique and playful café bar, serving up simple yet inventive, locally made finger foods, experimental drinks and great coffee. The large, open space will also host regular ticketed events, debates, talks and exhibitions, bringing people together from many diverse groups and creating a '3rd Space' for socializing, fusion and magical serendipity.

    <h2>DEMOGRAPHIC, ECONOMIC, SOCIAL AND CULTURAL FACTORS</h2>
    <img src="../img/article2.jpg"> Canada's economy needs innovative and creative thinkers and makers to evolve and develop. Schools are designed for the needs of a 20th Century workforce but we are in the midst of a technological revolution and the outdated curriculum is narrow and often dampens the flames of imagination. As a society we spend an unhealthy amount of time at computer screens, on smart phones, tablets and TVs. Information input overload, where are the opportunities to create output through imagination, creativity and experimental play and learning? The physical body has many opportunities for development through gyms and sports but where can our brains get a work out? How can we encourage discovery, innovation and creativity outside the formal educational environment? Inspired thinking comes from curiosity and excitement, fun and experience. It is vital to true learning and development.
    <br><br> The Canadian Government's Innovation Agenda 2016 states that, "The goal of education should be to make every Canadian "innovation ready"-ready to spot opportunities, imagine possibilities, discover new ideas, learn and grow. Developing a mindset that fosters creativity, risk-taking and ambition to succeed in the global marketplace should start early in life. Science, technology, engineering and financial literacy should be taught alongside business, math, social science and the arts."
    <br><br> Having taught in the secondary school education system for many years, I realize how difficult it is and how long it takes to make changes work within the system. I know first hand, how the system suppresses true creativity and innovation. A5 operates outside the system, it has the ability to adapt quickly and meet trends accordingly but also reinforces and believes in the goals of Canada's Innovation Agenda.
    <br><br> Ottawa's stable, health conscious, educated, cultured and wealthy population seeks value in new experiences and want the best for their children and grandchildren. They know our rapidly changing world needs creative thinkers and new skills. They desire quality, stimulating experiences and recognize the benefits of spending time together, face to face, enjoying and learning. A high proportion of empty nesters and retirees need places to socialize and spend time in worthwhile and enjoyable activities that link the community rather than separate it. Spending time with others, socializing and learning are not only have cognitive benefits but the social aspects are great for mental health too. "Socialization produces feelings of happiness, reduces stress, anxiety and depression and even improves cognitive function, quality of life and longevity. Humans are, by nature, social creatures." <br><br> Spending up to 90% of our time on screens deprives us of this basic human need. A5 is a place where people can spend time together, relax, learn and have fun in a welcoming, stimulating environment.
